As an experienced Data Scientist (ENTJ-A) specializing in NLP, machine learning, and AI-driven analytics, I build intelligent data pipelines, optimize AI models, and leverage behavioral insights for impactful decision-making. My background includes extensive work in business intelligence, cloud-based analytics, and structured prompt engineering for SaaS integration. During graduate school, I contributed to NOAA-funded coastal engineering research, collaborating with NOAA, SECOORA, and USGS on AI-powered coastal erosion analysis. I developed innovative computer vision solutions using object detection and segmentation techniques, transforming unstructured environmental data into actionable insights.
