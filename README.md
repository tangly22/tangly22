🚀 About Me
I’m a Data Scientist and AI Engineer specializing in NLP, machine learning, and cloud-based AI. My background spans media broadcasting, digital analytics, and business intelligence, evolving into AI-driven automation and data science research. I’ve worked on LLM optimization, computer vision for environmental monitoring, and predictive modeling for real-world impact. My current role is focused on NLP & Large Language Models (LLMs): Optimizing token efficiency, structured prompt engineering. I also recently compelted a project using Computer Vision: Object detection & segmentation for coastal erosion analysis (NOAA-funded research). I am passionate about Cloud-Based AI & MLOps: Building scalable AI solutions using AWS, GCP, and Azure
